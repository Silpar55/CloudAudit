**CloudAudit** is an AWS cost optimization SaaS platform for small-to-medium businesses.

**Problem**:

- AWS bills are confusing and opaque
- Companies waste 20-40% of cloud spend on unoptimized resources
- Enterprise solutions (CloudZero, nOps) start at $5K+/month - too expensive for SMBs
- Individual engineers and small teams have NO good solution

**Solution**:
CloudAudit provides a dashboard where users:

1. Connect their AWS account securely (via IAM role)
2. See costs broken down by service
3. Get AI-powered anomaly detection ("costs spiked 40% - here's why")
4. Receive cost optimization recommendations ("EC2 instance unused → save $150/month")
5. Implement changes with one click (safe, reversible)

**Business Model**:

- FREE: < $500/month AWS spend (free tier forever)
- STARTER: $49/month ($500-2K spend, anomaly alerts + email reports)
- PRO: $99/month ($2K+ spend, 1-click implementation + team allocation)
- ENTERPRISE: Custom pricing (multi-cloud, SLA)
